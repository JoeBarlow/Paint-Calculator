My original plan for this project was to create a custom “Square” shape that I could resize and extrude. 
I wanted to give the user the ability to add vertices and drag out newly created edges - essentially attaching a new square to the base room.

Given the time constraints, I was only able to lay out the foundation for this system and display the input/output with basic text boxes.

With more time to work on the project I would implement the following things:
   > Resizable square by dragging edges
   > The ability to add additional vertices
   > The ability to extrude edges and create custom shapes like an “L”
   > Exportable pdf of the results so the user can store them

I designed the 3 requirements: floor area, room volume and paint quantity with this in mind. 
By creating a new square object for extruded edges, I could loop through all existing squares and the 3 requirements would become the sum of their results.

I enjoyed working on this project as it was my first proper attempt at WPF and it was interesting to see what I could create with the tools available to me. 
If I were to attempt this again I would certainly pull back on my ambition and focus on a simpler UI - 4 hours is shorter than it seems. 
However, I’m sure with additional time to develop this project it would become an awesome solution to the problem, and have an interactive and intuitive design for the user.
